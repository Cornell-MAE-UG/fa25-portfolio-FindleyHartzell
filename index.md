## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I am from Chevy Chase, MD. I am a Rower on the Cornell Men’s Heavyweight Crew. I love to cook, eat, workout, and hang out with my friends. I enjoy learning about mechanisms and systems. I think that working at a bike or car manufacturer could be a great place to work in the future.
