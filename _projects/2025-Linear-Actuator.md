 HW 5:
 
 For my Statics class, I designed a lifting mechanism to maximize both the weight it can lift and the vertical reach within a 150 cm × 50 cm design area. The mechanism uses a single rigid bar pinned to two ground supports and a third roller support, with a linear RSX actuator placed near the bar tip to maximize the moment arm and therefore lifting capacity. I located the external load partway down the bar (at about 2/5 of its length from the pivot) to balance the trade-off between load and height—allowing the actuator to generate a higher maximum load while still raising the mass to nearly the full vertical max height for where I placed the load based on trigonometry (≈60 cm). All members and supports are assumed rigid, so the focus of the project was on geometry, force balance, and moment optimization. This design highlights the application of statics principles to achieve an efficient and stable lifting configuration suitable for possible later steps with CAD modeling and analysis.
